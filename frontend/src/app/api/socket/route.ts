// Note: For full WebSocket proxying in development, you would need:
// 1. Custom server setup with socket.io-client connecting to backend
// 2. socket.io server proxying events back to frontend
// 3. Or use Next.js custom server with WebSocket support
//
// For now, the client will connect directly to the backend WebSocket
// This is acceptable since WebSockets typically bypass CORS anyway
