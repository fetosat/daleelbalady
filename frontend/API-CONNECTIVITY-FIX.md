# API Connectivity Fix Applied ✅

## Problem Identified

The OfferService was failing with "Network Error" because your environment was configured to use `localhost:5000` for the backend API, but you don't have a local backend server running. However, the production API at `https://api.daleelbalady.com/api` is working perfectly and returning data.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ **Environment Configuration Updated**

Updated `.env.local` to use the working production API:

```bash
# OLD (causing Network Error)
BACKEND_API_URL=https://api.daleelbalady.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.daleelbalady.com

# NEW (working production API)
BACKEND_API_URL=https://api.daleelbalady.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.daleelbalady.com
```

### ✅ **Image Domain Added**

Added `images.unsplash.com` to Next.js image domains for offer images.

### ✅ **API Flow Verification**

The API flow is now correctly configured:

1. **Client-side**: `OfferService` calls `/api/offers` (Next.js proxy)
2. **Next.js proxy**: Forwards to `https://api.daleelbalady.com/api/offers`
3. **Production API**: Returns offers data (verified working)
4. **Response**: Flows back through proxy to client

## Test the Fix

### 1. Restart Development Server
Since environment variables changed, restart your server:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Offers Page
Navigate to: `https://www.daleelbalady.com/offers`

### Expected Result
- ✅ No more "Network Error" 
- ✅ Offers load successfully from production API
- ✅ Images display correctly
- ✅ Debug logs show successful API calls

## API Response Verified

The production API is returning valid offer data:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "offers": [
    {
      "id": "991f352b-a69b-4628-81e1-21682ef7b270",
      "title": "وفر 100 جنيه على خدمات الصيانة",
      "description": "احصل على خصم فوري 100 جنيه عند حجز أي خدمة صيانة...",
      "discountType": "FIXED_AMOUNT",
      "discountValue": 100,
      "isActive": true,
      "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581578731548-c64695cc6952?w=1200&h=400&fit=crop",
      // ... more offer data
    }
  ]
}
```

## Debug Information

### Environment Variables Now Set To:
- `BACKEND_API_URL`: `https://api.daleelbalady.com/api` 
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: `/api` (proxy path)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: `https://api.daleelbalady.com`

### Next.js Proxy Configuration:
- Source: `/api/:path*`
- Destination: `https://api.daleelbalady.com/api/:path*`

### Image Domains Allowed:
- `api.daleelbalady.com`
- `daleelbalady.com`
- `images.unsplash.com` (for offer images)

## Expected Console Output

After the fix, you should see:

```
🔄 Fetching offers with filters: {...}
📡 Making API request via Next.js proxy to: /offers?...
🔧 Proxy base URL: /api (same-origin)
✅ Offers API response: {success: true, offers: [...]}
```

Instead of the previous Network Error messages.

## Benefits

✅ **API Connectivity**: Direct connection to working production API
✅ **Real Data**: Actual offers from your backend
✅ **Image Loading**: Unsplash images for offers will load correctly  
✅ **No Local Dependencies**: No need to run local backend server
✅ **Socket Connections**: Will also connect to production WebSocket server

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check network tab**: Verify API calls are going to production URL
3. **Check console logs**: Should show successful API responses
4. **Restart server**: Environment variable changes require restart

## Summary

Your offers API is now connected to the working production backend at `https://api.daleelbalady.com/api`. The Network Error was caused by trying to connect to a non-existent local backend. Now your app will load real offer data from the production API! 🎉

**Quick Test**: After restarting your dev server, visit `/offers` page to see real offers loading from the production API.
