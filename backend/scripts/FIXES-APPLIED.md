# Test Listings Script - Fixes Applied

## Overview
The `create-test-listings.js` script has been completely rewritten to match the actual Prisma schema. The script was failing because it was trying to use fields that don't exist in the database models.

## Date Fixed
2025-01-09

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Service Model Structure** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: The script tried to create services with fields like `name`, `description`, `email`, `website`, `isVerified` directly on the Service model.

**Reality**: According to the Prisma schema:
- Service model does NOT have `name` or `description` at the root level
- These fields exist in the `service_translation` model (relation)
- Service only has: `embeddingText`, `phone`, `city`, `locationLat`, `locationLon`, `price`, `durationMins`, `currency`, etc.
- Fields like `email`, `website`, `isVerified` belong to the `Shop` model

**Fix**: 
- Created `service_translation` records first with `name_en`, `name_ar`, `description_en`, `description_ar`
- Linked services to translations via `translationId`
- Moved business-level info (email, website, verified status) to Shop records
- Used `ownerUserId` instead of `userId` for service ownership
- Used `shopId` to link services to shops for VERIFICATION, SERVICES, and PRODUCTS plans

### 2. **Provider Subscription Model** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Script used `userId` and invalid plan types like "FREE", "VERIFICATION", "SERVICES", "PRODUCTS"

**Reality**: 
- The field is `providerId`, not `userId`
- Valid enum values are: `BASIC_FREE`, `BOOKING_BASIC`, `PRODUCTS_PREMIUM`, `TOP_BRONZE`, `TOP_SILVER`, `TOP_GOLD`
- Required fields: `providerId`, `planType`, `pricePerYear`, `canTakeBookings`, `canListProducts`, `isActive`
- Invalid fields removed: `status`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `bookingLimit`, `productLimit`

**Fix**:
- Changed all `userId` to `providerId`
- Updated plan types:
  - "FREE" ‚Üí N/A (no subscription created)
  - "VERIFICATION" ‚Üí `BASIC_FREE`
  - "SERVICES" ‚Üí `BOOKING_BASIC`
  - "PRODUCTS" ‚Üí `PRODUCTS_PREMIUM`
- Added required fields: `pricePerYear`, `isActive`
- Removed invalid fields

### 3. **Service Availability Model** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Script tried to use fields like `isAvailable` and `slots` (JSON array)

**Reality**:
- No `isAvailable` field
- No `slots` field (this was meant to be a JSON structure)
- Valid fields: `serviceId`, `dayOfWeek` (enum), `startTime`, `endTime`, `isRecurring`, `timezone`

**Fix**:
- Removed `isAvailable` and `slots` fields
- Used correct WeekDay enum values: `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`
- Set `isRecurring: true` for weekly schedules
- Used simple time strings like "09:00" and "17:00"

### 4. **Product Model** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Script used non-existent fields

**Reality**:
- Does NOT have: `compareAtPrice`, `category`, `isAvailable`, `image`, `images`, `tags` (as array), `specifications`, `sellerId`
- Valid fields: `name`, `description`, `price`, `currency`, `stock`, `sku`, `isActive`, `embeddingText`, `shopId`, `listerId`

**Fix**:
- Removed all invalid fields
- Changed `isAvailable` to `isActive`
- Changed `sellerId` to `listerId`
- Moved specifications into the description text
- Simplified product data structure

### 5. **Review Model** ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Used `reviewerName` field and no author relationship

**Reality**:
- Must have `authorId` (required relation to User)
- No `reviewerName` field
- Valid fields: `id`, `authorId`, `rating`, `comment`, `serviceId`, `productId`, `shopId`, `createdAt`

**Fix**:
- Created reviewer users for each review
- Used `authorId` instead of `reviewerName`
- Properly linked reviews to services or shops

### 6. **Package.json Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Warning about module type not specified

**Fix**:
- Added `"type": "module"` to package.json to properly support ES modules

## Database Tables Populated

After running the script, the following tables will have test data:

1. **User** - 16+ test users (4 providers + reviewers)
2. **Shop** - 12 shops (VERIFICATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS plans)
3. **Service** - 16 services (all plan types)
4. **service_translation** - 16 translations
5. **ProviderSubscription** - 12 subscriptions

7. **Product** - 15-25 products (3-7 per shop)
8. **Review** - 32-96 reviews (2-6 per listing)

## Testing the Data

You can verify the data was created correctly:

```sql
-- Check users
SELECT id, name, email, role, isVerified FROM User WHERE email LIKE '%daleelbalady.com';

-- Check shops
SELECT id, name, email, isVerified, ownerId FROM Shop;

-- Check services
SELECT s.id, st.name_en, s.price, s.city, s.shopId 
FROM Service s 
LEFT JOIN service_translation st ON s.translationId = st.id;

-- Check subscriptions
SELECT id, providerId, planType, pricePerYear, canTakeBookings, canListProducts 
FROM ProviderSubscription;

-- Check products
SELECT id, name, price, stock, shopId FROM Product;

-- Check reviews
SELECT r.id, r.rating, r.comment, u.name as author_name 
FROM Review r 
JOIN User u ON r.authorId = u.id;
```

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Script now creates data correctly matching the schema
2. ‚úÖ All plan types are properly differentiated
3. ‚úÖ Realistic Egyptian city locations and bilingual content
4. ‚úÖ Proper relationships between all models
5. Test the frontend to ensure listings display correctly
6. Test booking functionality for SERVICES plan listings
7. Test product shopping for PRODUCTS plan listings
8. Verify search and filtering works with the test data

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter errors:

1. **Check your Prisma schema** - Run `npx prisma db pull` to ensure your schema matches the database
2. **Regenerate Prisma Client** - Run `npx prisma generate`
3. **Check database connection** - Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
4. **Clear existing data** - If needed, manually delete test users/shops before running again
5. **Check logs** - The script outputs detailed error messages for debugging
