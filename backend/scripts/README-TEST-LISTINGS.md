  specifications: {
    "Brand": "Brand Name",
    "Origin": "Egypt",
    "Quality": "Premium",
    "Warranty": "1 Year"
  }
}
```

## Availability Schedule Example

For SERVICES plan listings:

```javascript
{
  monday: {
    isAvailable: true,
    startTime: "09:00",
    endTime: "17:00",
    slots: [
      { time: "09:00", available: true },
      { time: "10:00", available: true },
      { time: "11:00", available: true },
      { time: "12:00", available: true },
      { time: "14:00", available: true },
      { time: "15:00", available: true },
      { time: "16:00", available: true }
    ]
  },
  // ... same for tuesday through saturday
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: User already exists
The script handles duplicate users gracefully. If a user with the same email exists, it will reuse that user for creating listings.

### Error: Database connection failed
Ensure your database is running and the connection string in `.env` is correct:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
```

### Error: Prisma client not generated
Run:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

## Customization

### Change Number of Listings
Edit line 442 in `create-test-listings.js`:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) { // Change 4 to desired number
```

### Add More Categories
Add to the `CATEGORIES` object (line 27):
```javascript
fitness: {
  name: "Fitness & Sports",
  nameAr: "ÿßŸÑŸÑŸäÿßŸÇÿ© ŸàÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿäÿßÿ∂ÿ©",
  subcategories: ["Gym", "Yoga", "Personal Training"]
}
```

### Change Default Password
Edit line 134:
```javascript
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash("test123456", salt);
// Change "test123456" to your desired password
```

## Database Impact

This script will create:
- **~16 users** (4 per plan type)
- **16 listings** (services/shops)
- **~15-30 products** (for PRODUCTS plan shops)
- **~60 reviews** (~4 reviews per listing)
- **~24 availability schedules** (for SERVICES plan)
- **~8 provider subscriptions** (for paid plans)

**Total records:** ~125-145 database entries

## Cleanup

To remove test data:

```sql
-- Delete test users and related data (cascades)
DELETE FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE '%@daleelbalady.com';

-- Or delete by plan type
DELETE FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE 'free-user-%@daleelbalady.com';
DELETE FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE 'verification-user-%@daleelbalady.com';
DELETE FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE 'services-user-%@daleelbalady.com';
DELETE FROM "User" WHERE email LIKE 'products-user-%@daleelbalady.com';
```
